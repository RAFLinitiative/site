<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section id="how">
    <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>

    <p>
        $RAFL is powering an endless number of raffle rounds.
    </p>
	
	<br></br>

    <p>
        Every day at 10PM EST a new round begins, running until 8PM EST the next day (22 HRS).
    </p>

	<br></br>

    <p>
        Players buy $RAFL and send it into the raffle pool for entries. At the end of the raffle round, one wallet will win the jackpot while the rest of the pool is reflected back into $RAFL.
    </p>
	
	<br></br>

    <p>
        Win or lose the round — $RAFL wins by design. Like a casino, where holders HOLD the house.
    </p>
	
	<br></br>

    <p>
        Liquidity Grows. <br>
	Holders Earn. <br>
        Supply Burns. <br>
	$RAFL Moons. Daily. <br>
    </p>

	<br></br>

    <p>
        This model guarantees that every round strengthens the token and rewards true holders, all while running degen raffles with compounding prizes.

<section id="current" class="section">
  <h2>HOW TO ENTER THE RAFFLES</h2>

  <div class="raffle-text">
    <p class="bold">ENTRY COST STRUCTURE</p>
    <p>The exact $RAFL cost per entry is posted in Telegram/X announcements right before the start of every round. (before 10PM EST)</p>
        <br></br>
    <p>Raffle entry costs are pegged to the following SOL value at the start of each round:</p>
	<br></br>
    <p>1 ENTRY = ~0.05 SOL<br>
       10 ENTRIES = ~0.5 SOL<br>
       100 ENTRIES = ~4 SOL</p>
	   <br></br>
	<p>However, entry cost may vary throughout each round if $RAFL price fluctuates — early entries guarantee the best value.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="bold">DAILY RAFFLE SCHEDULE</p>
    <p>
      - Rounds begin daily at <strong>10PM EST</strong><br>
      - End the next day at <strong>8PM EST</strong><br>
      - <em>2-hour gap (8PM–10PM)</em> for raffle pool allocation execution of previous round.

    <h3>WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Jackpot prizes will get big overtime. Degen gambling utility = buy pressure.</li>
        <li>Raffle entries are staked, can't move again until it goes through reflective allocations.</li>
        <li>Compounding holders rewards with payouts Early holders rewards will be airdrops, eventually replaced by manual claims via smart contract.</li>
	<li>Imagine if SAFEMOON had a gambling utility built in...</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="quote">EVERY ROUND STRENGTHENS THE HOUSE. INFINITELY.</h3>
</section>

<!-- HOLDERS TREASURY -->
<section id="holders">
    <h2>HOLDERS TREASURY</h2>
    <p>If you don't want to gamble for the jackpot, you can hold $RAFL to become an owner of the house. Like a casino, the house always wins in the long run. Daily snapshots record holders positions.</p>
    <p>Data is analyzed once per month to calculate your reward earnings. Your daily $RAFL position and a NO-SELL streak multiplier (number of days wallet went without initiating any $RAFL sells) is used to calculate rewards.</p>
    <p>Early holders rewards will be dispersed via airdrop but eventually I will implement a smart contract that automates the entire protocol.</p>
	
    	<br></br>

    <h3 class="quote">IF YOU SELL — YOU EXIT THE HOUSE. IF YOU HOLD — YOU OWN IT.</h3>

</section>

<!-- FUTURE -->
<section id="future">
    <h2>FUTURE UPGRADES</h2>

    <p>
        Dev will remove himself entirely from execution via smart contracts. Zero rug-risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Raffles pools will automatically be allocated at the end of each round, allowing the next round to begin without a two hour gap.
    </p>

    <p>
        Weekly and monthly raffles will be added, making more than one game ongoing at a time. (right now its only daily)
